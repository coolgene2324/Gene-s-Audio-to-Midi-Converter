## Features

This tool combines two major functionalities into a single, easy-to-use interface:

### üéπ **AI MIDI Converter**
- **YouTube to MIDI:** Paste one or more YouTube URLs to directly convert them into MIDI files.
- **Audio File to MIDI:** Upload your own audio files (`.mp3`, `.wav`, `.flac`, etc.) for transcription.
- **Batch Processing:** Process multiple URLs and files in a single session.
- **Advanced Trimming:** Specify start and end times to convert only a specific segment of an audio file.
- **Custom Naming:** Assign a custom base name to your output files.
- **GPU Acceleration:** Automatically uses a CUDA-enabled GPU if available for significantly faster transcription.

### ‚¨áÔ∏è **YouTube Downloader (IN DEVELOPMENT)**
- **Download Video & Audio:** Save content from YouTube as either video (`.mp4`) or audio-only (`.mp3`/`.m4a`).
- **Quality Selection:** Fetches all available quality options, allowing you to choose the perfect resolution or bitrate for your needs.
- **Detailed Format Info:** See file extensions, resolution, framerate, and estimated file size before you download.
- **Simple Interface:** Just paste a URL, fetch formats, and click download.

## Setup and Installation

To run this application on your local machine, you will need **Python 3.8+** and **FFmpeg**.

### Step 1: Install FFmpeg

FFmpeg is a required backend tool for audio processing.

-   **Windows:** Download a build from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). Extract the files and add the `bin` folder to your system's PATH environment variable.
-   **macOS (Homebrew):** `brew install ffmpeg`
-   **Linux (apt):** `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg`

### Step 2: Set Up the Project

1.  **Clone or Download:** Get the project files from this repository.
2.  **Navigate to Folder:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate into the project's root directory.
3.  **Run Setup Script (Windows):** If you are on Windows, simply double-click the `setup.bat` file. It will create the necessary folders and install all Python packages.
4.  **Manual Installation (macOS/Linux):**
    - Create the `templates` directory: `mkdir templates`
    - Install the required Python packages:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

*Note on PyTorch: The `requirements.txt` file installs the CPU version of PyTorch. If you have a CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPU, you can achieve a significant speedup by installing the GPU version. See the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for the correct command for your system.*
